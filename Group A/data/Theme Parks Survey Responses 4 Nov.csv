Yes you are bombarded with every movie character, but at least there is choice and variety and not just a mouse with black ears!

This theme park is incredibly clean and well run. I visited outside of the school holidays which definitely made the trip that much more pleasant and easy to navigate. Getting there via MRT was awesome. Another credit to the the super-efficient Singaporean government. And once you were in the Universal Studios park area, it seemed spacious, clean and lots to look at and do. There are so many rides (for all ages) and I have to say, I had a blast with my wife and seven year old son. One tip: pay for the premium ticket. Lines are long and it is worth every cent to not hang around and spend your time doing things.

I ate at the Hawker's Market which was really inexpensive and actually pretty good. A great family day with so many good memories.

Do it!"
