## About the Project

Attractions and entertainment venues often struggle to provide consistently excellent guest experiences due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the guest journey, preferences, and pain points. Traditional methods of gathering and analyzing guest data often fall short in providing actionable insights to improve operations, marketing strategies, and overall guest satisfaction.

This project aims to develop a data-driven system that maps and analyzes the entire guest journey, from pre-visit planning to post-visit feedback. By leveraging advanced data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling techniques, the project seeks to identify bottlenecks, optimize guest flow, personalize experiences, and ultimately boost guest satisfaction while potentially increasing revenue and operational efficiency.
